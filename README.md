# ImageRepoFrontend

This is the frontend code having component to render UI which gives provision to add and upload images. The backend APIs are called from this code.
This code is written in react.js.

Please find the video "ProjectWorkingAndCodeDescription.mp4" on the root to see the working of the project. As there is a connection to MongoDB I cant share mongo DB details. However I have shared screenshot "mongodb" of how the data looks like in mongo db.


To run this applicatio locally, type npm start in the terminal. Make sure the port number is 4000 because I am calling this api in the frontend part. If the port number is different make sure to change it in this file:
